Builder Pattern : The builder pattern is a creational design pattern that allows for the construction of 
complex objects step by step .It seperate the construction of complex object from its 
representation ,allowing the same construction process to create different representations .

 Why builder Pattern : It is useful when dealing with the objects that have large number of optional parameters .

 UseCases :
1 .Flexible object creation : When an object can be created in multiple ways or has many optional parameters , the builder pattern allows the construction 
                           process more flexible and intutive .
2. Hence it is the efficient tool for creating the objects in flexible ,readable and maintainable way .
