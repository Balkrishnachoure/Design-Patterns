Singleton Class -  It is a desing pattern which  ensure that a class has only one instance , and provides a global point of access to it . 

When to Use :  
1 .When there should be exactly one instance of the class .
2 .Singleton class are use for logging , caching ,thread pool ,data base connection .
3 DataBase Connection : Using Singleton pattern ensures that there is only one instance of database connection object .
4 Caching : By using Singleton pattern for cache manager , we can ensure that there is only one instance of cache , avoiding  duplication and ensuring 
  consistency in data .

Steps : 
1. Instance Variable - private static .
2. Constructor - private .
3. static method ( getInstance()) the return the object of singleton class .

Ways to implement singleton Desing pattern : 
1. Classic implementation : Makeing getInstance() static 
2. Make getInstance() synchronized .
3. Eager Instantiation : Static initialzr based implementation .
4. Use "Double checked Locking" - i.e using synchronized block .
